      <p>This is an alpha test version of software for “interactive
        evolution of camouflage” as described in my 2011 paper: <a
          href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/iec/">Interactive Evolution of
          Camouflage</a>. This 2021 app <strong><code>evo_camo_game</code></strong>
        is built from new components: the <a
          href="https://github.com/cwreynolds/TexSyn">TexSyn</a> library
        for procedural texture synthesis, and the <a
          href="https://github.com/cwreynolds/LazyPredator">LazyPredator</a>
        library for evolutionary optimization via genetic programming.
        For more information see the <a
          href="https://cwreynolds.github.io/TexSyn/">development blog
          for TexSyn</a>.</p>
      <h3>Very quick overview</h3>
      <p>This program is a crude simulation of the evolution of
        camouflage in nature. There is a predator-prey system. Software
        for texture optimization plays the part of an evolving
        population of camouflaged “prey.” The human user serves as a
        predator hunting its prey with vision. This can be seen as a
        sort of minimalist “game” or a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation">human

          based computation</a>. The app displays a window with a random
        portion taken from a given set of photographs. Over that
        background are drawn three randomly positions disks of synthetic
        texture—three “prey.” The human user/player/predator then
        decides which of the three textures/prey is <strong>most
          conspicuous</strong> or <strong>least well camouflaged</strong>,
        indicating their selection by clicking/tapping on that prey. The
        window will go blank then display the next step. Runs typically
        consist of 1000 such steps or more. They can be stopped at any
        time. Results are currently saved during as image files, and
        texture “source code” in text files, as described below.</p>
